## Traffic Sign Recognition Using Deep Learning

Overview
---
In this project, uses Tensorflow, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, to classify road traffic signs. Training and validattion of a LeNet-5 model is performed, so that it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). There is a pickled dataset in which there are resized images of 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set. 

After the model is trained, it is tested on 32 unseen images of German traffic signs that are found on the web. 


The Project
---
The implementation is done using python. The ![code][Code] implementation consists of follwing steps:

* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
